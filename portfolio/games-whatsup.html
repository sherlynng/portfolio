                    <h2 class="mb-5 header">Single Player</h2>
                    <p>Single player mode offers 5 difficulty levels (Lame, Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme). The levels are
                        designed with increasing difficulties and challenges to entice the player as he/she

                    <h4>How to Play?</h4>
                    <div class="gameplay">
                        <img src="../img/whatsup/singlePlayer.jpg" alt="">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Player first chooses which ‘Up’ he would like to play with (or randomly generated, depending
                                on your settings), for example, 7-‘Up’.
                            </li>
                            <li>When the game begins, the player need to search for the smallest tile in the grid and
                                start tapping the tiles in ascending order. Starting tile is 1.
                            </li>
                            <li>If the player press the correct tile, the tile will be replaced by a bigger number down
                                the number line, as shown below. Replacement of tile is in random order so the player cannot
                                predict the position of upcoming numbers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When the player encounter a tile that contains the ‘Up’ digit or is a multiple of the
                                ‘Up’ digit, he avoids it by tapping the Up! button instead. In a 7-‘Up’ game, user need to
                                avoid tiles such as 7,14,17,21,27,28……Failing to press the Up! button will lead to instant
                                Game Over.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the player press the wrong tile, player loses a life. Pressing wrong
                                tiles for 3 times will lead to Game Over.
                            </li>
                            <li>Given a time limit of 2 minutes, player will challenge to press as many tiles as
                                possible. Score will be calculated based on the highest number that the player reaches.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                                    Match two players. This mode has no time limit. For the first round,
                                    player A starts from increasing numbers (1,2,3...) while player B starts
                                    from decreasing numbers (100,99, 98...). Depending on where they meet,
                                    the players will get corresponding scores. They then switch position
                                    (player A starts from decreasing numbers and player B starts from
                                    increasing numbers). Combine scores from two rounds of game and
                                    determine winner.

                                    Time limit is imposed. The screen will display a UP buttons on both ends
                                    of the screen. Each player is in charge of half the grid and one UP
                                    button. Which UP button is to be pressed depends on the location of
                                    the UP number, for example, if the UP number appears on lower half of
                                    the screen, then the player in charge of the lower UP button must press
                                    it.
