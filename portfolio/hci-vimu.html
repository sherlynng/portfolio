            <p><b><i>VIMU</i></b> (VIsual MUsic) is a web application that not only simplifies the
                process of music mixing, but also allows customization of music visuals in a fun and enjoyable way. It
                allows easy mapping of local audio to keys on the computer keyboard and you will be able to create your
                own unique musical piece by simply tapping on the keys.</p>
            <p>This project is done in a group of 4 members, as part of CS3240 module.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="mb-3">Problem</h4>
            <p>While learning to compose electronic music may be an exciting idea, the steep learning curve and heavy
                investments into buying controllers, such as launchpad, may deter many from getting started in this
                niche field. My team notice this gap and want to create a platform for aspiring musicians to have a
                taste of how it is like to be in this field, by allowing them to play around with music composition in a
                fun and engaging way, such that they can make a better decision whether electronic music is for
                them. </p>

            <h3>User Study</h3><br>

            <p>To better understand the needs and frequently used features by electronic musicians, my team decided to
                conduct contextual inquiries with Electronic Music Lab (EML) members from National University of
                Singapore (NUS), who create and perform original electronic music live at various events.</p>
            <p>We went down to one of their Ableton Live basic workshop held on 15 September 2018 and conducted
                contextual inquiries with their current and new members. As we talked to them, we also asked them to do
                a think-aloud and demonstrate how they use the features in Ableton Live. After they finished the tasks,
                we also asked them the problems they face when creating/performing music. Below are some interesting
                findings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ableton Live is a complex application and the time taken to learn varies greatly (from 20 hours to
                    a few months).
                </li>
                <li>
                    When users first start using Ableton Live, they do not know where to start as there are too many
                    functions. Even up till now, most of them do not know all the functions and uses only around 60% of
                    the features available.
                </li>
                <li>During performance, there is limited engagement as audience only sees a musician on stage playing
                    with a controller/laptop, at most with some stage lighting and tilting the controllers towards the
                    audience such that they can see the lightings on the controllers.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-center">Performance by NUS EML</p>

            <h5>Key Features Used</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Quantization (allows music to be played on the beat or a fraction of the beat)</li>
                <li>Looping</li>
                <li>Toggling between on/off music on key press or hold key to play music</li>
                <li>Sound level display</li>
                <li>Mappign of audio to keys/controllers</li>
                <li>Importing music</li>
                <li>Sound library</li>
                <li>Recording/exporting of music</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Pain Points</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot immediately identify easily if an audio has been mapped to a key</li>
                <li>Cannot immediately identify the settings of an audio, eg looping, quantization</li>
                <li>Difficult to find music in the sound library</li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Current Applications</h3><br>

            <p>Besides conducting user studies, we also looked into current available applications for music mixing.
                From our research, applications in the market belong to two extreme fields. One extreme involves many
                advanced and complex tools that allows musicians to compose and mix music very precisely on the
                application (usually paid), while the other extreme is too simple and does not allow much customization
                (usually free).</p>

            <br>
            <h5>Complex Application</h5>
            <p>Ableton Live (used by NUS EML) is an advanced software music sequencer and digital audio workstation for
                professionals to compose and perform music live. It consists of many features and effects that allows
                musicians to create fine adjustments to music and also supports mapping of music to keyboard or external
                controllers.</p>
            <p>Although it can be a great application, the cheapest intro version costs USD 99 while the complete
                integrated version costs USD 749. Besides the cost, due to the wide variety of features available in the
                application, even with video tutorials, it will take some time for a beginner to get the hang of it.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>Simple Application</h5>
            <p>Patatap and Mikutap are examples of web applications that allows users to get started with music mixing
                easily by simply tapping on keyboard keys. </p>

            <p>Both uses visualizations, together with preloaded music, to create a fun experience for all users,
                regardless of their musical abilities. However, they are limited in scalability as both music and
                visualizations are preloaded and cannot be customized to users’ needs.</p>

            <h3>Target Audience</h3><br>

            <p>After researching into the current applications and findings from the user studies, my team decided to
                come up with an intermediate-level platform, which combines the key ideas of the applications. To
                prevent users from being overloaded with too many features, key features in Ableton Live will be
                extracted out to let users have a taste of it. Yet, we would like to retain the fun element in music
                composition by keeping the idea of music visualizations in Patatap and Mikutap but allowing more
                flexibility by letting users map their own audio and customize the type of visuals shown. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Our <b>main target audience</b> will be for aspiring musicians who would like to try electronic music
                composition but are unsure if it is their field and do not want to dive too deep into actual electronic
                music composition yet. VIMU will be a good platform for them to get started as it allows them to try out
                key features in music mixing in a fun and enjoyable way.</p>
            <p>Our <b>secondary target audience</b> will be the performers who would like to create better engagement
                with
                their audience through displaying interesting visualizations when they perform. VIMU allows
                customization in terms of mapping of audio to keyboard keys and type of visualizations shown (including
                colour and shapes). This new form of interaction with the audience can potentially make live
                performances more captivating.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h3>Persona</h3>
            <p>Following are the personas I have created for our two target audience after discussion with my team:</p>

            <h3>Prototype (Iteration 1)</h3>
            <p>My team followed parallel prototyping and decided to allow every member to have the freedom to design
                their own layouts and incorporate the features they deem necessary for the application for the first
                prototype.</p>
            <p>For my first prototype, I decided to incorporate almost all the features listed by the users, while
                ensuring that these features are made obvious and simple for users to understand.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Visualization mapping is also shown so that musicians need not remember the mappings and can

            <h4>Review for Prototype (Iteration 1)</h4>
            <p>After reviewing all the prototype designs, we decided to adopt a minimalist design and make VIMU a single
                page application (Yee Ru’s layout design) to reduce the number of screens such that the UI is simple and
                easy to navigate. As the main focus of the application is on the keyboard and visuals, we decided to
                make the keyboard occupy the most space as the keys contain information like track name and track
                progression. This is similar to my design for visualization and audio mapping, where the keyboard
                occupies half of the screen and the editing area occupying the other half. However, my idea of
                supporting different types of keyboards was scraped as we decided to focus on the most common keyboard
                design (QWERTY) for our final prototype. Also, after much discussion, we chose to remove the
                record/export feature as we felt that it belongs to a good-to-have feature but not essential to our main
                application. Sound wave display was also decided to be added in as it is the only way to visualize the
                sound in the application.</p>
            <p>Below is the layout of the design we have agreed on after the discussion:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="../img/vimu/prototype1-Review.png" alt="Prototype 1 Review" class="review">
            </div>

            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Prototype (Iteration 2)</h3>
            <p>With the layout established, each of us again created a second prototype to decide on the overall design
                and feel of the application. I decided to stick to my original prototype colour scheme – orange, as it
                is a gender-neutral colour and I felt that it will appeal to both genders. Following <i>Neilson’s
                    Heuristics H-4 (Consistency and standards)</i>, standard icons are also used to indicate hiding of
                keyboard,
                editing mode and information.</p>
            <h4 class="text-center">Interactive Prototype (Iteration 2)</h4>
            <div class="text-center">

            </div>

            <h4>Review for Prototype (Iteration 2)</h4>
            <p>For this round’s prototype, we took a vote on the design and colour scheme and we all chose my teammate
                -- Marlene’s design. For her design, users are able to choose between a few colour schemes and the
                rounded edged buttons gives a better feel and look to the keyboard.</p>
            <p>For the editing mode, Yee Ru’s design to enclose the track name in a box and colour it, creates a better
                understanding that the track is draggable from a key to another.</p>
            <div class="mb-4 text-center">

                <p>Yee Ru's Draggable Design</p>
            </div>
            <p>With that, we began to work on our final interactive prototype.</p>

            <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
            <p>For our final prototype, I created the overall layout for the application on HTML (using Bootstrap and
                jQuery) to facilitate further collaboration. Besides the overall layout, I am also responsible for the
                keyboard design.</p>
            <p>Following is a comparison between my teammate – Marlene’s prototype (left) and the HTML layout I have
                created (right):</p>

            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="../img/vimu/html-performance.PNG" alt="HTML Performance" class="ideation">
            </div>
            <p class="text-center">Performance Mode</p><br>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="../img/vimu/html-edit.PNG" alt="HTML Edit" class="ideation">
            </div>
            <p class="text-center">Edit Mode</p>

            <br>

            <p>However, as we worked on the project, we realized that the space allocated to sound and visuals
                customization was not sufficient. Hence, we decided to switch to tabbing between the two editing modes
                instead. The image below shows the changes made (blue box):</p>
